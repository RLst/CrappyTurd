Building your first game
	Why flappy bird? Because it was made in Vietnam, and is simple enough to be used as a base for learning the basics
	Setting up the basic flappy bird game scene
	Game mechanics; there probably many ways to do this, but heres how I would do it
		Player stays in place, only moves on the y axis
		Pipes spawn on the right
		Pipes move from right to left + y randomized
		Pipes despawn after
		Ground loop animates, UV texture right to left?
		Background parallax (intermediate)
		Score after pipe passes a certain threshold that is detected by a trigger collider

Scripting basics

		Download and install
		Install extensions
		Unity VS code setup
		Make sure intellisense works
		Make sure to refresh to avoid errors
	Monobehaviours

	Update()
	Input
	Transform and basic movement/translation
	DeltaTime
	Intermediate: public, serialization, [SerializeField]
	Intermediate: object pooling
	GetComponent and Caching

	Super simple example:
		Move object using WASD
		Challenge: shoot?, change speed
